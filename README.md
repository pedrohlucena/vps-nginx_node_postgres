# vps-nginx_node_postgres

My work on this project was only about: Docker, Nginx and deploy.

**I DIDN'T CODE THE PROJECT**, I didn't integrate it with the database, this was given ready in the Jackson Pires course "Docker for Javascript / Node.JS developers" and we worked on top of this project by dockerizing it and deploying it at Digital Ocean.
